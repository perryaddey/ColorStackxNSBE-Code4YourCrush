# 💖 Lehigh ColorStack x NSBE: Code 4 Your Crush 💖

Welcome to **Code 4 Your Crush**, a fun event where you can code your own Valentine’s Day card in HTML!  
Choose a template, customize it with your own message or image, and share it with a friend or crush.

## 📋 How This Works

Each Valentine card is a small HTML “mini-website” hosted using **GitHub Pages**, which means it works on **phones, tablets, and computers**. You can customize your card without needing any special software — just a browser.

### Templates

| Template Name          | Folder Name             | Description |
|------------------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Just Friends 💖        | `just-friends`         | A friendly Valentine card with an image and animation. |
| The Big Question ❤️    | `the-big-question`     | Ask someone to be your Valentine with a big, bold button. |
| Tap for Love 💘        | `tap-for-love`         | Interactive “surprise message” card using JavaScript. |
| Heartbeat ❤️           | `heartbeat`            | Animated heart with a simple, stylish Valentine message. |
| Sweet Talk 🍬          | `sweet-talk`           | A fun candy-gram style card listing compliments. |

## 🛠️ How to Customize Your Card

1. **Choose a template folder** you want to use (e.g., `just-friends/`).
2. **Add your image**:
   - Place your image file in the same folder as `index.html`  
   - Or, if using an `images/` folder inside the template, update `<img src="images/photo.jpg">`
3. **Edit the text** in `index.html`:
   - Change headings, messages, or colors
4. **Preview in your browser**:
   - Double-click `index.html` on your computer or open the GitHub Pages link
5. **Test on your phone**:
   - Open the link to make sure the layout looks good

## 📤 Sharing Your Card
